Association Rule Mining:

•	Implement an Apriori algorithm using tool like python with libraries such as Pandas and Mlxtend etc.

•	 Apply association rule mining techniques to the pre-processed dataset to discover interesting relationships between products purchased together.

•	Set appropriate threshold for support, confidence and lift to extract meaning full rules.


Analysis and Interpretation:
