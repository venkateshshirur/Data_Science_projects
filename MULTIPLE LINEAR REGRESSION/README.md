MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

Assignment Task:

Your task is to perform a multiple linear regression analysis to predict the price of Toyota corolla based on the given attributes.


Dataset Description:


The dataset consists of the following variables:

->Age: Age in years

->KM: Accumulated Kilometers on odometer

->FuelType: Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)

->HP: Horse Power

->Automatic: Automatic ( (Yes=1, No=0)

->CC: Cylinder Volume in cubic centimeters

->Doors: Number of doors

->Weight: Weight in Kilograms

->Quarterly_Tax: 

->Price: Offer Price in EUROs

Taskes:

1.Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. Provide visualizations and summary statistics of the variables. Pre process the data to apply the MLR.
